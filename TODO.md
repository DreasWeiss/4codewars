Welcome to my Codewars Solutions Repository! This repository contains my solutions to various kata (coding challenges) on Codewars, an educational community for computer programming.

## About Codewars

Codewars is where developers achieve code mastery through challenge. Train on kata in the dojo and reach your highest potential.

> Codewars is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as kata. These discrete programming exercises train a range of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online integrated development environment. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codewars)

Codewars is an online coding platform that helps users learn programming by solving challenges, competing with each other in real-time game tournaments, and connecting to a community of coders from around the world. Code Warriors can practice their skills through interactive tutorials while also being able to compete against one another for prizes!

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured as follows:

```
.
├── katas/
│   ├── kata-1/
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── kata.js
│   ├── kata-2/
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── kata.js
│   └── ...
├── README.md

```

- Each kata is stored in its own directory under the `katas/` folder.
- Each kata directory contains:
  - `README.md` with the problem description and other relevant information.
  - `kata.js` or other relevant files containing the solution.

## How to Use

1. Browse the `katas/` directory to find the kata you're interested in.
2. Read the `README.md` file in the kata directory to understand the problem.
3. Check the `kata.js` file for the solution.

Feel free to use these solutions as references for your own learning. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please create an issue or submit a pull request.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
3. Add your solution in the appropriate directory.
